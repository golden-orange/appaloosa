README:

The commit process will attempt to follow the following general guidelines effecting frequency:
- upload all files completed during a tutorial session at end of same session
- upload all files that are created during out of session practice laps

All example or practice files will be given their own unique folder, ensuring that file names and paths are always standard (eg index.html, main.css, script.js).
